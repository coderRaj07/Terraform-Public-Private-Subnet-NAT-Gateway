Certainly, here's a simplified README for your Terraform project:

# Terraform AWS Infrastructure Setup

This Terraform project is designed to create an AWS infrastructure with a clear separation between a public subnet and a private subnet. The project allows you to deploy resources in a modular and organized way, making it easy to manage and understand the components.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to establish a VPC with public and private subnets, enabling the deployment of different types of services within AWS:

- **Public Subnet**: In this subnet, you can launch EC2 instances that need direct internet access. An Internet Gateway is connected to this subnet, providing internet connectivity.

- **Private Subnet**: For services that require a private network and secure outbound internet access, this subnet is connected to a NAT Gateway, allowing EC2 instances to access the internet through Network Address Translation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into modules for clear separation of responsibilities:

- **Network Module**: This module handles the VPC, public and private subnets, Internet Gateway, and Route Tables.

- **NAT Gateway Module**: Manages the creation of the NAT Gateway and Elastic IP.

- **Security Group Module**: Defines the security group used by EC2 instances for controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

- **EC2 Instance Module**: Launches EC2 instances in both the public and private subnets.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.

2. Update the necessary variables in each module according to your specific requirements.

3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform environment.

4. Execute `terraform plan` to review the changes Terraform will make.

5. If the plan looks good, apply the changes with `terraform apply`.

6. Follow the prompts to confirm the changes.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this project to fit your specific needs. You can adjust variables, security group rules, and instance types to match your use case.

## Cleanup

To remove the resources created by this project, use `terraform destroy` after making sure that you no longer need them.
